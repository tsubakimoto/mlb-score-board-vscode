## Installation

1. Install the extension from the VS Code marketplace
2. The extension will be automatically activated

## Usage

1. After installation, the "MLB Scores" section will appear in your Explorer sidebar
2. Scores will load automatically when the extension activates
3. Click the refresh button (ðŸ”„) in the tree view title to update scores
4. Each game shows: "AWAY_TEAM AWAY_SCORE - HOME_SCORE HOME_TEAM" with status

### Viewing Games for a Specific Date

You can configure the extension to show games for a specific date:

1. Open VS Code Settings (File > Preferences > Settings)
2. Search for "MLB Score Board"
3. Set the "Game Date" field to a date in `MM/DD/YYYY` format (e.g., `12/25/2024`)
4. Leave the field empty to show today's games (default behavior)

The scores will automatically refresh when you change the date setting. When a custom date is configured, the date will be displayed in the view title (e.g., "MLB Scores - 12/25/2024").

## Score Format

Games are displayed in the following format:
```
AWAY_TEAM AWAY_SCORE - HOME_SCORE HOME_TEAM    [STATUS]
```

For example:
```
NYY 10 - 5 BOS                                [Final]
CHC 4 - 7 CIN                                [Final]
SEA 4 - 0 HOU                                [In Progress]
